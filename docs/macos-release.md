# Building and shipping the macOS app

## Build

```bash
cd app && npm ci && npm run tauri build
```

The app and a disk image land in `app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` (`macos/OpenSmith.app`,
`dmg/OpenSmith_<version>_aarch64.dmg`). Apple Silicon only.

## What a built app uses on the player's Mac

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Song library | `~/Music/OpenSmith` (`OPENSMITH_LIBRARY` to change it) |
| Song converter (Python pipeline) | carried inside the app, installed on the first import into `~/Library/Application Support/app.opensmith.desktop/pipeline-ingest` |
| Settings, progress, career | the app's web storage |

The first import installs the converter: `uv sync` downloads Python 3.11, PyTorch, Demucs and
Basic Pitch (about 2 GB, a few minutes on a good connection). The imports screen shows it as an
extra first step. A new version of the app installs its own copy again on its first import.

The player needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and ffmpeg (`brew install uv ffmpeg`). Without uv, the game works but imports fail with a message
saying what to install.

A development build (`npm run tauri dev`) keeps using the repository: `pipeline-ingest` through
`uv run`, and the repository's `out/` folder as the library when it exists.

## Signing and notarisation

Today the app is only ad-hoc signed. A copy downloaded from the internet is quarantined, and
Gatekeeper refuses to open it ("OpenSmith cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for
malicious software", or "is damaged").

### Workaround for players (unsigned builds)

1. Move `OpenSmith.app` to `/Applications`.
2. Open it once; when macOS refuses, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down
   and click **Open Anyway** (macOS 15 and later; on macOS 13–14, right-click the app → Open).
3. Or, in a terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OpenSmith.app`

### Proper fix: Developer ID + notarisation

Needs a paid [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership
(99 USD a year). Then:

1. Create a **Developer ID Application** certificate (Xcode → Settings → Accounts, or the
   developer website) and install it in the login keychain.
2. Create an **App Store Connect API key** (Users and Access → Integrations → Keys) for
   notarisation.
3. Build with these environment variables; Tauri signs with the hardened runtime, notarises
   and staples the app and the disk image on its own:

   ```bash
   export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAM_ID>)"
   export APPLE_API_ISSUER=<issuer id>
   export APPLE_API_KEY=<key id>
   export APPLE_API_KEY_PATH=/path/to/AuthKey_<key id>.p8
   npm run tauri build
   ```

   (Or `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` — an app-specific password — and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.)
   In CI, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (the .p12, base64) and `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` import the
   certificate into a temporary keychain.
4. Check: `spctl -a -vv /path/to/OpenSmith.app` must say `source=Notarized Developer ID`.

`app/src-tauri/Entitlements.plist` grants `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`: under the
hardened runtime that comes with a Developer ID signature, the guitar input would otherwise be
silently muted. The app starts `uv` and the Python pipeline as child processes, which the
hardened runtime allows; they are not signed by us and do not need to be.
