"""Biomechanical fingering solver: notes (time, pitch) → playable (string, fret) tablature.

Viterbi over hand states. A state is a placement of a slice's notes (one onset: a single note or
a chord) on distinct strings, plus the fret under the index finger — the *anchor*, which is
also what the game uses to move the camera and highlight frets. The costs model what makes a
part hard to play:

* moving the hand, proportionally to the hand speed it requires (frets / time available), with
  a fixed cost per position shift and a steep extra cost beyond four frets — no 12-fret jumps
  between sixteenth notes;
* stretching beyond the four-fret box of one finger per fret;
* fretting instead of letting open strings ring, playing high on the neck;
* unidiomatic chord voicings (strings out of pitch order, muted strings inside a strum) and
  chords needing more than four fingers; changing string set between consecutive chords
  (parallel shapes such as power chords or fourths keep their strings);
* in lines: skipping strings, crossing back to a lower string while the melody rises (or the
  reverse), grabbing open strings while the hand plays up the neck.
