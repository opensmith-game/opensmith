//! A game session: the audio engine plays the backing track and listens to the guitar, the game
//! judges what it hears against the chart, and the UI receives a stream of events.
//!
//! Timing: the output callback publishes when each backing-track frame reaches the listener, the
//! input callback when each guitar sample was captured, both in host time. An attack is placed in
//! the song where the player *heard* it, whatever the latencies of the two devices.
