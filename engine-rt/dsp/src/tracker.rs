//! Streaming note tracker: onset-gated, growing-window pitch detection → note events.
//!
//! Latency model. A note is timestamped at its attack (`onset_sample`, found within a sample or
//! two), which is what gameplay timing uses. Its pitch can only be confirmed once the window
//! since the attack holds `(1 + min_overlap)` fundamental periods (a periodicity must be seen
//! repeating) — about 16 ms for the open low E (period 12.1 ms), 5-6 ms for the high e. The
//! tracker re-analyses every `hop` samples (64 = one CoreAudio buffer), so confirmation arrives
//! at the first buffer where the evidence is sufficient.
//!
//! Segmentation. Besides attacks, a sustaining note is watched by a periodicity-break detector:
//! every sample is predicted from the sample one period earlier, on the note's first five
//! harmonics only (higher partials of a stiff string drift out of phase every period). A re-pick
//! of the same string whose level barely changed, a hammer-on, a pull-off or a fast slide all
//! break that prediction within about a millisecond. The analysis window then restarts at the
//! break, so it never mixes two notes; the outcome (same pitch + energy rise or strong break →
//! re-pick, other pitch → new note, legato when no energy was added) is decided once the new
//! pitch is confirmed.
