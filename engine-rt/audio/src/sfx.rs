//! Sounds mixed over the guitar and the song: the interface's clicks, the game's cues, the
//! crowd. Each plays once, now or when the song reaches a frame (a count-in on the beat);
//! one background sound (the crowd) loops, its gain gliding to where it is asked to be. Voices
//! are kept in room reserved up front: the callback never allocates, and the caller keeps its
//! own reference to every sound, so the callback never frees one either.
