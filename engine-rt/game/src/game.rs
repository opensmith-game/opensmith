//! Game rules: judging the player against the chart, score and streak, dynamic difficulty.
//!
//! Times are song seconds (the backing track's clock). Notes are judged on their *attack*
//! timestamp from the tracker, known within a millisecond, even though the pitch is confirmed
//! up to ~18 ms later on the low E: a late confirmation never makes a hit late. Chords are
//! judged by the chord verifier, which the engine runs on the audio of the chords listed by
//! `chords_ready`.
//!
//! A note is judged to the nearest semitone once the player's own tuning drift, learnt from the
//! notes hit, is taken off, and an octave off counts (pickups and trackers slip by one). Dead
//! notes, muted strums and pinch harmonics have no pitch to check: their attack is judged alone.
//! A natural harmonic is judged at the pitch it sounds.
//!
//! A miss says why, from what the guitar played around the note: nothing, the right note too
//! early or too late, another note (too high, too low), or a strum the verifier did not hear as
//! the chord. A note played late enough to come after its miss explains it then (`Late`).
//!
//! Dynamic difficulty: every phrase name has its own level. When a phrase
//! iteration is over, a good run (≥ `level_up` accuracy) raises that phrase's level, a poor one
//! (< `level_down`) lowers it. The level of an iteration is fixed when it becomes visible,
//! `lookahead` seconds before it starts, so notes never change under the player's eyes.
